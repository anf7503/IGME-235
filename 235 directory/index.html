                    Hi! I'm Aaron Fleischer. I am a 3rd year Game Design and Development student at RIT from New Jersey. 
                    I like playing video games, listening to music, and playing basketball.
                    My goal is to start or be a part an indie group and make games that break the mold.
                    I hope to learn how to create websites well through this course.
                    During my time at RIT, I've met many people from various places who are all striving to do their best.
                    I further myself by taking inspiration from these hardworking individuals I meet.
                    While I am still not sure what my future holds, I want to be able to have decent all around knowledge of the different aspects 
                    of game development and know what I want to do with my career by the time I graduate so I can work towards being great in my field.
