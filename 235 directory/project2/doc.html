            One of the main things I wanted to do with this API was make it look similar to MyAnimeList. I think I did that pretty well
            considering that I actually used some of the same colors MyAnimeList uses. I'm honestly surprised it came out this well.
        </p>
        <p>The name "Miru" means watch or look in Japanese, so I thought it was appropiate for an anime searching site</p>
        <p>
            Having the scroll appear when you hover over the box was anothering thing I was proud of doing. At first, I had overflow: scroll 
            on at all times, but I didn't like how that looked and it wasn't how MyAnimeList did there results, so I searched on google how 
            to have the scroll only when its being hovered over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going back to the similarity to MyAnimeList, The links are the same way with the exception of a:active having a state. I thought that 
            might make it hard to tell it was a link, so I made it bold. It may be still a bit difficult to determine, but I also made sure the only
            blue bold fonts were links. It may not help a bunch, but it's there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving a bit away from the look of the page, finding the other two ways to access the results was another highlight for me. After looking at 
            what Jikan returned, I found out how to access the name search results instantly, but I didn't get the genre results on the first try. I did manage 
            a little while later when I looked at the results again.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my JavaScript, I added three booleans so that all I had to do for each of the different searches was have different initial .onclick 
            functions and 1 function for when the xhr data loaded with if statements to handle which search is being used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I think I could have added some more features if I had organized myself better, I am still rather proud of myself for making the website 
            look this good to me.
