        <h2>Project 1 Deliverable</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Taking into account feedback, I swapped the resume and the contact info</li>
            
            <li>It creates more space, but I try to counteract it by spacing out the sections more</li>
            
            <li>Added missing requirements such as navbar, link colors, finished documentation</li>
            
            <li>
                Using main messed up the layout (probably since it become the direct child)
                so I didn't use it.
            </li>
            
            <li>I removed a lot from the youtube video and the form to get the html validated, so if it doesn't work, that's why.</li>
            
            <li>The CSS was validated as well</li>
            
            <li>Not that it matters, but this page is validated too</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>First Deliverable</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Used my 235 page as basis</li>
            
            <li>Generally, I wanted a simplistic page
                with an easy layout that was easy to make
                and update and easy for someone on the 
                page to navigate
            </li>
            
            <li>Used a logo instead of a portrait since the
            requirements only required a logo and not
            a portrait
            </li>
            
            <li>Placed contact info next to about me since it took more space</li>
            
            <li>Made a gallery with the 2 class projects and a unity project I am working on in a team right now</li>
            
            <li>I went with a purple blue aesthetic because I thought it looked cool and my logo is red and blue</li>

            <li>Had small images, so I just slapped the images right into the page</li>
        </ul>
