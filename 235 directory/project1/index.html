                <p>
                    Hello! I am an aspiring Game Developer and UI/UX Designer from New Jersey. 
                    I enjoy finding what most aesthetically pleases the eye.
                    I am a Junior at Rochester Institute of Technology.
                    During my time at RIT, I've developed a skillset that includes proficiency in 
                    C#, C++, Unity, Maya, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript among other things.
                    In my free time, I like to sketch and work out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Miru is a website that finds anime based on the name, day it airs, or genre. 
                    It utilizes the Jikan API to search for anime. The visual design is made to simulate 
                    the same design as MyAnimeList, the website the Jikan API uses for its anime.
                    Wrapping my head around APIs and the Jikan API specificaly was a little difficult
                    at first, but I managed to properly utilize the API for this website in the end.
                    I also learned how to make scrolling sections like this one you are reading now because of it.

                <p>
                    Mr. Galaxy is a game I made in Pixi.js that was inspired by Space Invaders and utilized a template. 
                    From the start of the game, you choose one of three difficulties to play and go through levels 
                    that get harder as you go on until you hit the difficulty cap.
                    Once I overcame my unfamiliarity with Pixi.js and learned how to implement what I wanted into the 
                    game, making it was fairly straight forward. Some ideas I had to compromise to finish in time, but
                    I am still proud of how it came out.

                <p>
                    This game is a tower defense game where you guard your Halloween candy from monsters.
                    The team I was on made this game in 6 weeks. I was responible for the entire main menu and the UI on the game,
                    along with some other miscellaneous tasks like programming the ghost enemy. The weeks we spent making the game
                    were a bit hectic, so we didn't do as much as we wanted with the game, but we're proud of what we could get
                    done in that time. We also made 2 board games.
